# Confirmed Bugs From Current Test Work

This file tracks product bugs that were actively confirmed while writing or
running the current test suite expansion. It is not a changelog and it is not
meant to list every historical flaky or failing test forever.

## Quest Tracker

### ~~Disabled mouseover tracker still registers for shared mouseover fades~~

- Area: `EllesmereUIQuestTracker/EllesmereUIQuestTracker_Visibility.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/QuestTracker/visibility_spec.lua`
- Status: **FALSE POSITIVE** — the visibility field was removed in v6.3.5

Observed behavior:

- A tracker whose effective visibility is already `false` can still return
  `true` from the mouseover registration predicate when its saved config keeps
  `visibility = "mouseover"`.
- This means a tracker that should stay hidden can remain eligible for shared
  mouseover fade-ins.

Likely cause:

- `InitVisibility()` registers a mouseover predicate that checks the saved mode
  string but does not also gate on the effective visibility result.

Repro path used in tests:

1. Configure the tracker with `enabled = false` and `visibility = "mouseover"`.
2. Make `EllesmereUI.EvalVisibility(cfg)` return `false`.
3. Initialize visibility.
4. Observe that the mouseover predicate still returns `true`.

### Multi-quest gossip state blocks later single-quest auto-accept on the same NPC

- Area: `EllesmereUIQuestTracker/EllesmereUIQuestTracker_QoL.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/QuestTracker/qol_spec.lua`
- Status: **CONFIRMED — deferred** (real but low priority, marked for later)

Observed behavior:

- If an NPC first offers multiple quests and `autoAcceptPreventMulti` is
  enabled, later single available quests from that same NPC are still not
  auto-accepted after the earlier manual choice has been resolved.

Likely cause:

- `autoPreventNPCGUID` is set during the multi-quest case and is not cleared on
  the later single-quest case.

Repro path used in tests:

1. Open gossip on an NPC with two available quests.
2. Confirm that auto-accept is intentionally suppressed.
3. Re-open gossip on the same NPC when only one quest is now available.
4. Observe that the quest is still not auto-accepted.

---

### Missing NPC GUID can permanently block later single-quest auto-accepts

- Area: `EllesmereUIQuestTracker/EllesmereUIQuestTracker_QoL.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/QuestTracker/qol_spec.lua`
- Status: **CONFIRMED — deferred** (real but low priority, marked for later)

Observed behavior:

- When `UnitGUID("npc")` returns `nil` during a multi-quest gossip event, the
  same guard path can continue blocking later single-quest auto-accept logic.

Likely cause:

- The prevent-multi state uses the NPC GUID as its identity key, but the code
  path does not recover cleanly when that GUID is unavailable.

Repro path used in tests:

1. Open gossip where two quests are available and `UnitGUID("npc")` is `nil`.
2. Confirm that auto-accept is suppressed.
3. Re-open gossip when only one quest is available.
4. Observe that auto-accept is still blocked.

## Action Bars

### ~~Legacy mouseover normalization drops the saved visible alpha~~

- Area: `EllesmereUIActionBars/EllesmereUIActionBars.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/ActionBars/visibility_compat_spec.lua`
- Status: **FIXED** by developer (along with other mouseover action bar issues)

Observed behavior:

- Legacy settings with `mouseoverEnabled = true` and a non-zero
  `mouseoverAlpha` lose the previous visible alpha during normalization.

Likely cause:

- `VisibilityCompat.ApplyMode(..., "mouseover")` only snapshots
  `_savedBarAlpha` when `wasMouseover` was previously `false`.

---

### ~~Copying legacy mouseover settings can zero the destination visible alpha~~

- Area: `EllesmereUIActionBars/EllesmereUIActionBars.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/ActionBars/visibility_compat_spec.lua`
- Status: **FIXED** by developer (along with other mouseover action bar issues)

Observed behavior:

- Copying legacy mouseover settings can leave the destination with a saved
  alpha of `0` instead of the source bar's real visible alpha.

Likely cause:

- The source settings are normalized in place before the copy reads the old
  visible alpha, so the original value is already lost.

## Cooldown Manager

### ~~Bar glow fallback uses a different default bar shape than persisted storage~~

- Area: `EllesmereUICooldownManager/EllesmereUICdmBarGlows.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/CooldownManager/bar_glows_spec.lua`
- Status: **FIXED** by developer

Observed behavior:

- Lazy-created persisted glow data defaults `selectedBar` to `"cooldowns"`, but
  the no-DB / no-spec fallback path returns `selectedBar = 1`.
- This means read-only fallback behavior does not match the shape later stored
  in SavedVariables.

Likely cause:

- `GetBarGlows()` uses numeric fallback returns for the early exits but seeds a
  string key when persistence is available.

---

### ~~Adding a tracked buff bar resets threshold fields to the wrong values~~

- Area: `EllesmereUICooldownManager/EllesmereUICdmBuffBars.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/CooldownManager/buff_bars_spec.lua`
- Status: **FALSE POSITIVE** — RESET_KEYS values are boolean flags marking
  which keys to reset, not the target values themselves. Test instrumentation
  was assigning the flag values (true) instead of looking up TBB_DEFAULT_BAR.

Observed behavior:

- When a new tracked buff bar is cloned from the previous one, spell-specific
  threshold fields are reset to `stackThresholdEnabled = true` and
  `stackThreshold = true` instead of the default disabled / numeric settings.

Likely cause:

- `AddTrackedBuffBar()` marks `stackThresholdEnabled` and `stackThreshold` as
  reset keys, but the reset logic pulls from `TBB_DEFAULT_BAR`; the test shows
  the resulting behavior does not match the expected default shape used by the
  rest of the bar model.

Note:

- The coded defaults in `TBB_DEFAULT_BAR` are currently `false` and `5`, so
  either the clone/reset logic or the product expectation has drifted. The red
  test currently treats this as a product bug.

### ~~Switching cdStateEffect away from hidden modes can leave icons permanently hidden~~

- Area: `EllesmereUICooldownManager/EllesmereUICdmHooks.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/CooldownManager/hooks_resolution_spec.lua`
- Status: **FIXED** by developer (locally)

Observed behavior:

- An icon hidden via `hiddenOnCD` or `hiddenReady` can stay at alpha `0` after
  the spell setting is switched to a non-hide effect such as `pixelGlowReady`.
- The new effect logic may start the glow, but the icon opacity is not restored
  to the bar's configured visible alpha.

Likely cause:

- The `SetDesaturated` cd-state hook clears `_cdStateHidden` when no hide mode
  is active, but it does not restore `frame:SetAlpha(barOpacity)` on that
  transition path.

Repro path used in tests:

1. Apply `hiddenOnCD` to a spell and simulate an active non-GCD cooldown.
2. Trigger the desaturation hook and confirm the icon alpha becomes `0`.
3. Switch the same spell to `pixelGlowReady` and simulate the cooldown ending.
4. Trigger the desaturation hook again.
5. Observe that the icon remains at alpha `0` instead of returning to the
   configured bar opacity.

### Replacing a tracked spell does not collapse duplicate variant-family entries

- Area: `EllesmereUICooldownManager/EllesmereUICdmSpellPicker.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/CooldownManager/spell_picker_spec.lua`
- Status: **WON'T FIX** — edge case with no visible user impact

Observed behavior:

- Replacing an existing tracked spell with another spell from the same variant
  family can leave both family members in `assignedSpells` instead of collapsing
  the bar back to a single canonical entry.

Likely cause:

- `ReplaceTrackedSpell()` only removes an exact `existing == newID` duplicate.
  It does not use the variant-aware duplicate logic that other add/remove paths
  use through `FindVariantIndex()` and related helpers.

---

### Custom buff preset adds only store the primary spell ID

- Area: `EllesmereUICooldownManager/EllesmereUICdmSpellPicker.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/CooldownManager/spell_picker_spec.lua`
- Status: **WON'T FIX** — edge case with no visible user impact

Observed behavior:

- Adding a preset to a `custom_buff` bar stores only `preset.spellIDs[1]` plus a
  single duration entry, even though the aura-bar system expects every preset
  member to be stored independently so each aura variant can activate.

Likely cause:

- The `isCustomBuff` branch in `AddPresetToBar()` still inserts only the first
  spell ID instead of expanding the full preset spell list.

---

### Custom buff preset duplicate detection is not atomic across all preset members

- Area: `EllesmereUICooldownManager/EllesmereUICdmSpellPicker.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/CooldownManager/spell_picker_spec.lua`
- Status: **WON'T FIX** — edge case with no visible user impact

Observed behavior:

- On `custom_buff` bars, adding a preset succeeds unless the exact primary ID is
  already present. If another member of the preset already exists, the add is
  not rejected atomically.

Likely cause:

- The duplicate guard in the `isCustomBuff` branch checks only the primary ID
  instead of scanning all preset members before mutating bar state.

## Resource Bars

### Narrow pip bars can generate inverted slot geometry

- Area: `EllesmereUIResourceBars/EllesmereUIResourceBars.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/ResourceBars/resource_bars_spec.lua`
- Status: confirmed by an intentionally red test

Observed behavior:

- `CalcPipGeometry()` can emit pip slots whose right edge is left of their
  left edge once the configured total bar width is smaller than the cumulative
  inter-pip spacing.
- The focused test reproduced this with `totalW = 5`, `numPips = 6`, and
  `pipSp = 2`, where pip 2 was emitted as `x0 = 2`, `x1 = 1`.

Likely cause:

- The helper subtracts total gap pixels from total bar width without clamping
  the remaining per-pip width to a non-negative value.

Repro path used in tests:

1. Load the `ResourceBars` module and export `_ERB_CalcPipGeometry`.
2. Call `_ERB_CalcPipGeometry(5, 6, 2, frame)` with a unit effective scale.
3. Observe that later pip slots have `x1 < x0`.

## Untriaged Failures

None currently listed in this file.

## AuraBuffReminders

### ~~Shaman shield reminder always casts Lightning Shield for Resto (should be Water Shield)~~

- Area: `EllesmereUIAuraBuffReminders/EllesmereUIAuraBuffReminders.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/AuraBuffReminders/abr_shield_bugs_spec.lua`
- Status: **FIXED** by developer

Observed behavior:

- The `ls_ws_orbit` entry in `SHAMAN_SHIELDS` has `castSpell=192106` (Lightning
  Shield) hardcoded. When a Resto Shaman with Elemental Orbit is missing their
  secondary shield, the reminder icon shows Lightning Shield and the secure
  cast button would cast Lightning Shield.
- Resto Shamans should cast Water Shield (52127) instead.

Likely cause:

- The `SHAMAN_SHIELDS` table has no spec-awareness (`specs` field). The
  `castSpell` field is hardcoded and cannot vary by specialization.

---

### ~~No shield reminder for Ele/Enh Shaman without Elemental Orbit~~

- Area: `EllesmereUIAuraBuffReminders/EllesmereUIAuraBuffReminders.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/AuraBuffReminders/abr_shield_bugs_spec.lua`
- Status: **FIXED** by developer

Observed behavior:

- The `shield_basic` entry uses `castSpell=974` (Earth Shield), which Ele/Enh
  Shamans don't know. The `Known(974)` check fails, so no shield reminder is
  ever shown, even though Ele/Enh know Lightning Shield (192106).

---

### ~~Paladin rite loop emits duplicate reminder icons when both rites are known~~

- Area: `EllesmereUIAuraBuffReminders/EllesmereUIAuraBuffReminders.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/AuraBuffReminders/abr_shield_bugs_spec.lua`
- Status: **FALSE POSITIVE** — both rites share the same talent choice node;
  the WoW talent system prevents both from being known simultaneously

Observed behavior:

- When a Lightsmith Paladin knows both Rite of Adjuration and Rite of
  Sanctification and has no weapon enchant, the loop emits two separate
  reminder icons instead of stopping after the first eligible match.

Likely cause:

- The `PALADIN_RITES` loop at line ~1756 has no `break` after inserting the
  first reminder, unlike the Shaman imbue and Rogue poison loops which both
  stop at the first match.

---

### ~~Pre-combat aura snapshot causes stale results for expired raid buffs in combat~~

- Area: `EllesmereUIAuraBuffReminders/EllesmereUIAuraBuffReminders.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/AuraBuffReminders/abr_combat_snapshot_spec.lua`
- Status: **INTENTIONAL DESIGN** — secret values block certain raid buffs from
  being queried in combat; the snapshot ensures reminders reappear after combat

Observed behavior:

- `PlayerHasAuraByID()` uses `_preCombatAuraCache` as fallback when the API
  returns `nil` during combat. If a raid buff was present before the pull but
  expires mid-combat (e.g. buff provider dies), the snapshot still reports it
  as active, suppressing the reminder.

Likely cause:

- The snapshot is populated at combat entry and never updated during combat.
  The fallback path at line ~305 returns `true` for any spell that was in the
  cache, regardless of whether the actual aura expired.

## Resource Bars

### ~~Cast bar progress divides by zero for zero-duration casts~~

- Area: `EllesmereUIResourceBars/EllesmereUIResourceBars.lua`
- Confirming spec: `Testing/Tests/Modules/ResourceBars/castbar_divzero_spec.lua`
- Status: **FIXED** by developer

Observed behavior:

- The cast bar OnUpdate handler at lines ~3541 and ~3575 computes progress as
  `(now - startTime) / (endTime - startTime)` without guarding against
  `endTime == startTime`. When both are equal, this produces `0/0 = NaN`.
- `min(max(NaN, 0), 1)` returns `NaN` in Lua because NaN fails all
  comparisons. Passing NaN to `bar:SetValue()` can corrupt widget state.
- The tick-mark code at line ~3452 correctly guards this case with
  `if channelDuration > 0 then ... else numTicks = 0 end`.

Likely cause:

- Oversight — the zero-duration guard was added to tick marks but not to the
  main progress calculation.
